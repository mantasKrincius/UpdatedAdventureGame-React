                <li>If you run out your HP, go to healer in town or wait till regenerate hp, 10 seconds = 1hp (the same
                    about MP)
                </li>
                <li>Your inventory can store only 8 items(without spell scrolls), make sure you always have 1 spot, cus
                    there is basic items, unique items and boss items and how good they are depends on your level too.
                </li>
